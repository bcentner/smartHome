- Voice greetings when recognized users are detected
- Multi-user support with session management

### üé§ Voice Interface
- Text-to-speech feedback using pyttsx3
- Voice announcements for user recognition
- Voice responses for system commands

### üè† Home Automation
- **Smart Light Control**: Control Kasa smart lights via IP address
  - Turn lights on/off
  - Adjust brightness
  - Change colors (red, green, blue, white)
- **Weather Information**: Get real-time weather data
  - Temperature
  - Wind speed
  - Precipitation
  - Sunrise/sunset times
- **Music Player**: Play music files using mpg123

### ü§ö Hand Gesture Recognition (Experimental)
- Finger counting and gesture detection
- Visual feedback for hand gestures
- Configurable gesture responses

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- Webcam for facial recognition
- Microphone (optional, for future voice input features)
- Smart lights compatible with Kasa protocol

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- Face recognition libraries
- Internet connection for weather API

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd smartHome
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3 opencv-python face-recognition imutils requests cvzone
   ```

3. **Install system dependencies**
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install mpg123
   
   # For macOS
   brew install mpg123
   
   # For Windows
   # Download mpg123 from https://www.mpg123.de/
   ```

## Setup

### 1. Facial Recognition Setup

The system requires pre-trained facial encodings. You need to:

1. Create a `facial_recognition/` directory
2. Add an `encodings.pickle` file with known face encodings
3. The system will automatically copy this file to the working directory

**Note**: The `encodings.pickle` file should contain a dictionary with:
- `"encodings"`: List of face encodings
- `"names"`: List of corresponding names

### 2. Smart Light Configuration

Update the IP address in `logic.py` for your Kasa smart lights:
```python
cmd = ["kasa", "--host", "192.168.12.238"]  # Change to your light's IP
```

### 3. Weather API (Optional)

The system uses Meteomatics API for weather data. For production use, you may want to:
- Sign up for an API key
- Update the weather function to use authentication
- Currently uses mock data for demonstration

## Usage

### Starting the System

Run the main driver:
```bash
python driver.py
```

The system will:
1. Initialize the facial recognition system
2. Start the webcam feed
3. Begin monitoring for recognized faces
4. Provide voice feedback when users are detected

### Available Commands

Once logged in, you can use these commands:

- **`lights`** - Control smart lights
  - Choose "on" or "off"
  - Set brightness (0-100)
  - Choose color: red, green, blue, or white

- **`weather`** - Get weather information
  - Choose: temp, wind, precip, sunrise, or sunset

- **`music`** - Play music file (requires `music.mp3` in directory)

- **`logout`** - Log out current user

- **`help`** - Display available commands

### Example Usage

```
Hi. What would you like to do? lights
On or off? on
Brightness? 80
Color? blue
```

## File Structure

```
smartHome/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ driver.py              # Main application driver
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logic.py               # User management and command logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facial_req.py          # Facial recognition system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hand_req.py            # Hand gesture recognition (experimental)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facial_recognition/    # Directory for face encodings
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ encodings.pickle   # Pre-trained face data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
```

## Configuration

### Voice Settings
Modify voice properties in `driver.py`:
```python
eng.setProperty('rate', 160)  # Speech rate
eng.setProperty('voice', voices[16].id)  # Voice selection
```

### Camera Settings
Adjust camera source in `facial_req.py`:
```python
vs = VideoStream(src=0, framerate=2).start()  # Change src for different cameras
```

### Weather Location
Update coordinates in `logic.py` for your location:
```python
# Current: Chicago coordinates (41.8781, -87.6298)
url = f"https://api.meteomatics.com/{formatted_datetime}/{format}/41.8781,87.6298/html"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not found**
   - Check camera permissions
   - Try different camera sources (src=0, 1, 2, etc.)

2. **Face recognition not working**
   - Ensure `encodings.pickle` file exists
   - Check lighting conditions
   - Verify face is clearly visible

3. **Voice not working**
   - Install system text-to-speech drivers
   - Check audio output settings

4. **Smart lights not responding**
   - Verify IP address is correct
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure Kasa CLI is installed

### Error Messages

- `"Found encodings"` - System found face data
- `"Copyied encodings"` - System copied face data to working directory
- `"Recognized [name]"` - Face recognition successful
- `"Hello [name]"` - Voice greeting for recognized user

## Security Considerations

- The system stores face encodings locally
- No data is transmitted to external servers (except weather API)
- Consider implementing additional authentication for sensitive operations
- Regularly update face encodings for security

## Future Enhancements

- Voice command input
- Integration with more smart home devices
- Mobile app interface
- Scheduling and automation features
- Enhanced security features
- Support for more weather APIs
