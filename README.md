### Software Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- Face recognition libraries
- Internet connection for weather API

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd smartHome
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3 opencv-python face-recognition imutils requests cvzone PyYAML
   ```

3. **Install system dependencies**
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install mpg123
   
   # For macOS
   brew install mpg123
   
   # For Windows
   # Download mpg123 from https://www.mpg123.de/
   ```

4. **Setup configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example configuration
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   
   # Edit the configuration file with your settings
   nano config.yaml
   ```

## Setup

### 1. Configuration Setup

The system uses a YAML configuration file for all settings:

1. **Copy the example configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. **Edit the configuration file** with your specific settings:
   - Update smart light IP addresses
   - Set your location coordinates for weather
   - Configure voice settings
   - Adjust camera settings

### 2. Facial Recognition Setup

The system requires pre-trained facial encodings. You need to:

1. Create a `facial_recognition/` directory
2. Add an `encodings.pickle` file with known face encodings
3. Update the `encodings_file` path in your `config.yaml`
4. The system will automatically copy this file to the working directory

**Note**: The `encodings.pickle` file should contain a dictionary with:
- `"encodings"`: List of face encodings
- `"names"`: List of corresponding names

### 3. Smart Light Configuration

Update the smart light settings in your `config.yaml`:
```yaml
smart_lights:
  kasa_host: "192.168.12.238"  # Your light's IP address
  kasa_port: 9999              # Kasa port
  default_brightness: 80       # Default brightness
```

### 4. Weather API (Optional)

The system uses Meteomatics API for weather data. For production use:
- Set `use_mock_data: false` in your config
- Update location coordinates in the weather section
- The system includes caching and error handling for API calls

## Usage

### Starting the System

Run the main driver:
```bash
python driver.py
```

The system will:
1. Initialize the facial recognition system
2. Start the webcam feed
3. Begin monitoring for recognized faces
4. Provide voice feedback when users are detected

### Available Commands

Once logged in, you can use these commands:

- **`lights`** - Control smart lights
  - Choose "on" or "off"
  - Set brightness (0-100)
  - Choose color: red, green, blue, or white

- **`weather`** - Get weather information
  - Choose: temp, wind, precip, sunrise, or sunset

- **`music`** - Play music file (requires `music.mp3` in directory)

- **`logout`** - Log out current user

- **`help`** - Display available commands

### Example Usage

```
Hi. What would you like to do? lights
On or off? on
Brightness? 80
Color? blue
```

## Configuration

All configuration is now managed through the `config.yaml` file. The system includes:

### Configuration Management
- **Centralized Settings**: All settings in one YAML file
- **Validation**: Automatic configuration validation on startup
- **Defaults**: Fallback to sensible defaults if configuration is missing
- **Environment Support**: Easy to modify for different environments

### Key Configuration Sections

**Voice Settings**:
```yaml
voice:
  rate: 160                    # Speech rate
  voice_index: 16              # Voice selection
  volume: 1.0                  # Volume level
```

**Camera Settings**:
```yaml
camera:
  source: 0                    # Camera source
  framerate: 2                 # Processing framerate
  width: 500                   # Frame width
```

**Smart Light Settings**:
```yaml
smart_lights:
  kasa_host: "192.168.12.238"  # Your light's IP
  colors:
    red: [0, 100, 80]          # HSV color values
```

**Weather Settings**:
```yaml
weather:
  location:
    latitude: 41.8781          # Your latitude
    longitude: -87.6298        # Your longitude
  use_mock_data: true          # Use mock data for testing
```

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

The system now includes comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms:

### Error Handling Features
- **Custom Exceptions**: Specific error types for different components
- **Automatic Recovery**: Attempts to recover from common errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation when possible
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error logging with context
- **Error Statistics**: Track and monitor error patterns

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not found**
   - Check camera permissions
   - Try different camera sources in config.yaml
   - Verify camera is not in use by another application

2. **Face recognition not working**
   - Ensure `encodings.pickle` file exists and path is correct in config
   - Check lighting conditions
   - Verify face is clearly visible
   - Adjust tolerance setting in configuration

3. **Voice not working**
   - Install system text-to-speech drivers
   - Check audio output settings
   - Verify voice index in configuration

4. **Smart lights not responding**
   - Verify IP address is correct in config.yaml
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure Kasa CLI is installed
   - Check light power and network status

5. **Configuration errors**
   - Validate your config.yaml file
   - Check for syntax errors
   - Ensure all required sections are present

### Error Messages & Logging

The system now provides detailed logging:
- **Log File**: Check `smartHome.log` for detailed error information
- **Console Output**: Real-time status and error messages
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic attempts to recover from failures

### Debugging

To enable debug logging, set in your config.yaml:
```yaml
system:
  log_level: "DEBUG"
```

## Security Considerations

- The system stores face encodings locally
- No data is transmitted to external servers (except weather API)
- Consider implementing additional authentication for sensitive operations
- Regularly update face encodings for security

## Future Enhancements

- Voice command input
- Integration with more smart home devices
- Mobile app interface
- Scheduling and automation features
- Enhanced security features
- Support for more weather APIs
